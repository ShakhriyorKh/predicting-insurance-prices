*ML algorithm for predicting an insurance cost based on 7 parameters: age, sex,children, smoker, region, charges.
Using a dataset from Kaggle.*

#### First Model
I have used a linear regression to train my model. I have got a fairly good results on the testing set.

#### Second Model
After that I have made some tweaks on the model and have made normalization of the dataset. As a result, the model displayed about 10% better prediction.
