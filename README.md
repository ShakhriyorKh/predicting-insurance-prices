# Predicting Insurance Prices

*ML algorithm for predicting insurance cost based on 7 parameters(age, sex,children, smoker, region, charges).
Using a dataset from Kaggle.*

#### First Model
I have used linear regression to train my model. I have got fairly good results on the testing set.

#### Second Model
After that I have made some tweaks on the model and have made normalization of dataset. As a result, model displayed about 10% better prediction.
